PostMark
Disk Test
This is a test of NetApp's PostMark benchmark designed 
to simulate small-file testing similar to the tasks 
endured by web and mail servers. This test profile will 
set PostMark to perform 25,000 transactions with 500 files 
simultaneously with the file sizes ranging between 5 and 512 kilobytes.

This utility test profile is maintained by Michael Larabel. 
This OpenBenchmarking.org test profile was created on 
6 December 2010 and last updated on 8 February 2020. 
To run this test with the Phoronix Test Suite, 
the basic command is: phoronix-test-suite benchmark postmark.
